# Ensemble Methods
#### Revisiting Decision Trees:
- Desicion Trees are supervised learning models.
- Two types of trees:
  - Classification Trees (Out-come is classification)
  - Regression Tress (Out come is Continues)
- We have two potential problems with trees:
  - **Overfitting**: They tend to overfit on data, reducing the performance of the model on future data.<br>
    (A decision tree can split deeply to perfectly fit the training data -- memorizing noise and specific patterns in data.)
  - **Variance error**: Small changes in data can yield a big change in resulting tree.<br>
    (Since decision trees tend to overfit, a slighlty different dataset can produce different splits.)
