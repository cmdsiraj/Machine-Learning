# Variance error
Variance error refers to how much the model's prediction changes when trained on different subsets of data.
In simple terms:
- **High variance** means the model learns the training data too well (overfitting) and performs poor on the new data.
- **Low variance** means the model is **stable**, and small changes in training set don't affects its predictions much.
